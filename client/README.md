# Getting Started with eShop CMC (Web)

## Run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### Notes
The solution uses `React 18.0.9`, `typescript 4.6.4` and `React Context` to mane the state.

#### Improvements
The UI is very basic, more work needs to be done to make it look better.\
A lot more tests need to be added.
